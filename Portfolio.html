                        <p>I am currently a senior majoring in IS&T who is a year ahead which means I am graudating a year early. I have been enjoying Temple even though a lot of my experience has been online, but I know we will be back to normal soon enough.</p>

                        <p>I enjoy hiking in the woods, swimming, playing video games, and cooking as my main hobbies. My favorite type of food is Italian and I really enjoy building computers. I began building computers when I was a freshman in high school. Since then, I have built dozens of computers for people and am always keepimg up on the newest technology advancements. Additionally, I travel around the world frequently.</p>
